A damage recognition complex composed of 2 UvrA and 2 UvrB subunits scans DNA for abnormalities.

DNA wrap is dependent on ATP binding by UvrB and probably causes local melting of the DNA helix, facilitating insertion of UvrB beta-hairpin between the DNA strands. Then UvrB probes one DNA strand for the presence of a lesion. If a lesion is found the UvrA subunits dissociate and the UvrB-DNA preincision complex is formed. This complex is subsequently bound by UvrC and the second UvrB is released.

The first reaction step involves the formation of a hemiacetal intermediate between G3P and a cysteine residue, and this hemiacetal intermediate is then oxidized to a thioester, with concomitant reduction of NAD to NADH. The reduced NADH is then exchanged with the second NAD, and the thioester is attacked by a nucleophilic inorganic phosphate to produce BPG. It can both NADP and NAD. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9226260}.","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) (phosphorylating) activity [GO:0004365]; NAD binding [GO:0051287]; NADP binding [GO:0050661]; glucose metabolic process [GO:0006006]; glycolytic process [GO:0006096]","glucose metabolic process [GO:0006006]; glycolytic process [GO:0006096]","glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) (phosphorylating) activity [GO:0004365]; NAD binding [GO:0051287]; NADP binding [GO:0050661]","cytoplasm [GO:0005737]","GO:0051287; GO:0050661; GO:0005737; GO:0006006; GO:0004365; GO:0006096",-0.10237388724036,337,0.15,0,0,"o",36.5

If damaged D1 is not removed then new D1 cannot be inserted to restore the PSII reaction center. Seems to also degrade damaged and/or unassembled PSII proteins D2 and PsbB (CP47). May recognize D1 via its first 20 amino acids, as deletion of these prevents the PSII repair cycle. Also seems to degrade cytoplasmic GGPS, glucosylglycerol-phosphate synthase. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12953117, ECO:0000269|PubMed:17208194}.","integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]; thylakoid membrane [GO:0042651]; ATP binding [GO:0005524]; ATP-dependent peptidase activity [GO:0004176]; metalloendopeptidase activity [GO:0004222]; metallopeptidase activity [GO:0008237]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]; photoinhibition [GO:0010205]; photosystem II repair [GO:0010206]; proteolysis [GO:0006508]; PSII associated light-harvesting complex II catabolic process [GO:0010304]","photoinhibition [GO:0010205]; photosystem II repair [GO:0010206]; proteolysis [GO:0006508]; PSII associated light-harvesting complex II catabolic process [GO:0010304]","ATP binding [GO:0005524]; ATP-dependent peptidase activity [GO:0004176]; metalloendopeptidase activity [GO:0004222]; metallopeptidase activity [GO:0008237]; zinc ion binding [GO:0008270]","integral component of membrane [GO:0016021]; thylakoid membrane [GO:0042651]","GO:0005524; GO:0004176; GO:0010304; GO:0016021; GO:0004222; GO:0008237; GO:0010205; GO:0010206; GO:0006508; GO:0042651; GO:0008270",-0.15311004784689,627,48.02,20.39,2,"o15-37i115-137o",68.51

Essential for inhibiting damaged induced by excess blue-green light via a process known as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) (PubMed:16531492, PubMed:18687902, PubMed:20368334). In the dark or dim light the stable inactive form (OCP-O) is orange, upon illumination with blue-green light it converts to a metastable active red form (OCP-R), inducing energy dissipation, quenching cellular fluorescence via NPQ (PubMed:18687902, PubMed:20368334). One OCP-R molecule is sufficient to quench 1 phycobilisome (PubMed:21764991). More OCP-R accumulates under high-light and low temperature; in the dark OCP-R spontaneously reverts to OCP-O (PubMed:18687902). Reversion of OCP-O is accelerated by FRP (PubMed:20534537, PubMed:23716688). A kinetic study suggests conversion of OCP-O to OCP-R is limited by cis-trans proline isomerization of either Gln224-Pro225 or Pro225-Pro226 (PubMed:21907180). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16531492, ECO:0000269|PubMed:18687902, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20368334, ECO:0000269|PubMed:20534537, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21764991, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21907180, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23716688}.","phycobilisome [GO:0030089]; chloride ion binding [GO:0031404]; photoreceptor activity [GO:0009881]; light absorption [GO:0016037]; protein-chromophore linkage [GO:0018298]; transport [GO:0006810]","light absorption [GO:0016037]; protein-chromophore linkage [GO:0018298]; transport [GO:0006810]","chloride ion binding [GO:0031404]; photoreceptor activity [GO:0009881]","phycobilisome [GO:0030089]","GO:0031404; GO:0016037; GO:0009881; GO:0030089; GO:0018298; GO:0006810",0.00473186119874,317,0.81,0.72,0,"o",34.67
